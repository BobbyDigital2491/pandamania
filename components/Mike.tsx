           Mutants will introduce a new era for NFTs, it is a true form of bridging the gap between Web 2 and Web 3!
            The Mutant Pandas will solve issues that nearly 98% of NFT projects will continue to face, even now majority are facing this issue, 
            "How to maintain consistent cash flow for stable project growth?" Mutants will introduce Hedera ecosystem into a way of combining real world 
            businesses with digital projects without straying away from the quality of each!

            <b>How will they bridge the gap?</b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            By partnering with Clown Society to invest/ create real world businesses that'll bring in consistent cash flow back into the project, 
            without the need or pain of creating continuous projects here after. This also creates a source of income to fund $MNGO activities, 
            long term and maintain value for project holders.
